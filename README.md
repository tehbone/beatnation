# beatnation

Beatnation (stylized as Beatnat!on) was a collaborative effort between a few
Cornell University students for the GDIAC (Game Design ... something or other)
program back in 2004. The buggy concept of a game was demoed to some locals
with quite a few chuckles. Since then, the code and all of its assets have
collected dust.

This project is a revitalization of the original effort. The goal is to at least
attempt to finish some of the features that were left either unimplemented or
completely unfinished. Looking at the code, about 98% of the features were left
unimplemented.

## Concept (paraphrased from early design documents)

Set in a distant future where the man controls all forms of rhythmic entertainment...
OK I'm going to stop here. I don't remember the original design document, but the
game was supposed to be a Smash-bros meets Power Stone brawler, with some beat
mechanics to it, a-la Def Jam Fight for NY.

## What's left?

Everything

# Major Items

It compiles, but it will crash hard. If you don't believe me, compile and try.
